# ServerVideoPlayer
A responsive node.js app that lets the client browse and play videos in the server's directory. The user can search for videos by name, watch the videos in the browser, or hover over thumbnails to see a preview. The server reads the video directory in real-time, so every the server admin can easily add or remove videos without having to restart the server.
